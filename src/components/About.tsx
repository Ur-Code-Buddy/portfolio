      <div className="max-w-4xl"> <Paragraph className="mt-4"> Hey there, I&apos;m Baivab Dutta â€“ a tech enthusiast, developer, and engineering explorer. My passion for computers and engineering started early, driving me to complete studies in computer science, mathematics, and electronics. Welcome to my digital space! </Paragraph> <Paragraph className="mt-4"> Since day one, I&apos;ve been fascinated by creating and building things. My journey has included experimenting with robotics, setting up servers, and designing electronics components. I&apos;ve worked across tech domains, from Web2 and Web3 to exploring AI, pushing myself to keep learning and growing. </Paragraph> <Paragraph className="mt-4"> One of my memorable projects was building a drone in my freshman year, which was a pretty cool milestone in my journey. Outside of tech, I have a love for simple, effective design. I believe in the beauty of minimalism, where function meets elegance. </Paragraph> <Paragraph className="mt-4"> When I&apos;m not coding or exploring new tech, you might find me strumming a guitar, diving into ideas, or simplifying designs. This space is a window into my projects and thoughts. Whether you&apos;re a developer, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about what I&apos;m working on, there&apos;s something here for you. </Paragraph> <Paragraph className="mt-4"> Thanks for stopping by, and I&apos;m excited to share this journey with you. </Paragraph> </div>
